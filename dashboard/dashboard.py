Based on my analysis, here are the key takeaways:

1. The majority of products purchased by customers weigh less than 1 kilogram. This could indicate a preference for lightweight items or digital goods.
2. In terms of review scores, the top three categories are flowers, childrenâ€™s fashion clothes, and male fashion clothing. These categories consistently receive high ratings from customers. On the other hand, home comfort (2nd category), furniture/mattresses/upholstery, and fashion sport are the three categories with the lowest average review scores.
3. The most popular product categories among Brazilian customers are bed/bath/table, furniture/decor, and health/beauty. These categories may represent essential and frequently used items in daily life.
4. Customers are widely distributed across more than half of Brazil, with a significant concentration near Sao Paulo. This city alone ordered for nearly 90,000 customers between 2017 and 2018.
5. August is the peak month for purchases, which could be related to specific events, holidays, or seasonal shopping habits.
Weekdays are the most popular days for making purchases. This could be due to the availability of customers or specific shopping habits during the workweek.
6. Afternoon is the most popular time of day for customers to make purchases. This could be when customers have free time or when they are most likely to engage in online shopping.
7. The majority of customers prefer to use credit cards for their purchases. This could indicate a preference for the convenience and security offered by credit card transactions.

In conclusion, businesses could focus on improving the quality of products in categories with lower review scores or consider offering promotions during peak shopping times.
